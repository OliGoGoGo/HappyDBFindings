# HappyDBFindings
In this project I will carry out an exploratory data analysis of the corpus of HappyDB and write a blog on interesting findings.

Texts are explored using tools from text mining and natural language processing such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, etc, all available in R and write a blog post using R Notebook. 
 
The blog will be in the form of a data story blog on interesting trends and patterns identified by the analysis of these happy moments.
