# HappyDBFindings
In this project I will carry out an exploratory data analysis of the corpus of [HappyDB]([url](https://megagon.ai/happydb-a-happiness-database-of-100000-happy-moments/)) and write a blog on interesting findings.

Texts are explored using tools from text mining and natural language processing such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, etc, all available in R and write a blog post using R Notebook. 
 
The blog will be in the form of a data story blog on interesting trends and patterns identified by the analysis of these happy moments.



# Project Overview:
We have already gotten the source where people's happiness come, but I'm curious about the activities which can drive people happier, and try to get some conclusions on it. In general, the goal of this project is to analyze the distribution of these happiness levels to understand how people express their happiness in various degrees.

# Project Steps:

1: Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Clean the dataset by removing irrelevant and noisy data.
Perform text preprocessing tasks: tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.

2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

 2.1: Generate summary statistics: the distribution of happiness levels, and common keywords or phrases.

 2.2: Word Clouds and Keywords:

    Generate word clouds to highlight the most frequently mentioned words or phrases associated with happiness.
    Identify interesting keywords and phrases that appear in the happy moments.

3: Sentiment Analysis:

Apply sentiment analysis to classify the happiness levels of the moments (extremely happy, very happy, moderately happy, slightly happy, neutral happy).
Visualize the distribution of happiness levels in the dataset.

4: Topic Modeling:(word2Vec)

Use topic modeling techniques (e.g., LDA or NMF) to identify common themes or topics within the happy moments.
Visualize the topics and their prevalence in the dataset.

5: Temporal Analysis:

Analyze whether there are any temporal patterns in the happy moments by examining the timestamps associated with each entry.
Create time series visualizations to show how happiness evolves over time.



7: Data Storytelling:

Combine the insights gained from data mining, statistical analysis, and visualization into a cohesive data story.
Create a narrative that explains the findings in a clear and engaging manner, catering to a general audience.
Visualization:

Develop informative and visually appealing charts, graphs, and infographics to support the data story.
Use storytelling techniques to guide the audience through the analysis and insights.

8: Conclusion and Reflection:

Key findings and insights: 
Reflect on the significance of understanding and celebrating moments of happiness.
Presentation and Sharing:

This project will not only provide valuable insights into the HappyDB dataset but also allow you to practice data mining, statistical analysis, and data storytelling skills while sharing the joyous moments of individuals with others.
